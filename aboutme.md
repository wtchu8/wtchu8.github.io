- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a MONAI/PyTorch workflow for deep learning organ/tissue segmentation of chest CT images
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to tune self-supervised tasks to improve deep learning organ/tissue segmentation using unlabeled CT scans
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on infectious disease imaging and AI research
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I would be happy to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wtchu/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play the ukulele in my free time
